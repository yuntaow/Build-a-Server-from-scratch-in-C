# Build-a-server-from-scratch-in-C
My full mark project for Computer System at the Unimelb. I upload this because there wasn't a good tutorial teaching you how to create HTTP multi-thread server built in c from scratch. Hopefully, this repository will provide convenience for anyone who is interested.
