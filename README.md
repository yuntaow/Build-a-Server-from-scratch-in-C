# Build-a-server-from-scratch-in-C
My full mark project for Computer System at the Unimelb. I upload my code because there wasn't a good tutorial/sample code online about how to create HTTP multi-thread server built in c from scratch. Hopefully, this repository will provide help for anyone who is interested in learning socket programming in c.
